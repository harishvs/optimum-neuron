    "\n",
    "[AWS Trainium (Trn1)](https://aws.amazon.com/de/ec2/instance-types/trn1/) is a purpose-built EC2 for deep learning (DL) training workloads. Trainium is the successor of [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf1/?nc1=h_ls) focused on high-performance training workloads. Trainium has been optimized for training natural language processing, computer vision, and recommender models used. The accelerator supports a wide range of data types, including FP32, TF32, BF16, FP16, UINT8, and configurable FP8. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest Trainium instance, the `trn1.32xlarge` comes with over 500GB of memory, making it easy to fine-tune ~10B parameter models on a single instance. Below you will find an overview of the available instance types. More details [here](https://aws.amazon.com/de/ec2/instance-types/trn1/#Product_details):\n",

    "## 1. Setup AWS environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use the `trn1.32xlarge` instance on AWS with 16 Accelerator, including 32 Neuron Cores and the [Hugging Face Neuron Deep Learning AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-gr3e6yiscria2). The Hugging Face AMI comes with all important libraries, like Transformers, Datasets, Optimum and Neuron packages pre-installed this makes it super easy to get started, since there is no need for environment management.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post doesn’t cover how to create the instance in detail. You can check out my previous blog about [“Setting up AWS Trainium for Hugging Face Transformers”](https://www.philschmid.de/setup-aws-trainium), which includes a step-by-step guide on setting up the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the instance is up and running, we can ssh into it. But instead of developing inside a terminal we want to use a `Jupyter` environment, which we can use for preparing our dataset and launching the training. For this, we need to add a port for forwarding in the `ssh` command, which will tunnel our localhost traffic to the Trainium instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "PUBLIC_DNS=\"\" # IP address, e.g. ec2-3-80-....\n",
    "KEY_PATH=\"\" # local path to key, e.g. ssh/trn.pem\n",
    "\n",
    "ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 -i ${KEY_NAME}.pem ubuntu@$PUBLIC_DNS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets now pull the optimum repository with the [example notebook and scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/tree/main/notebooks/text-generation).\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we can change our directory to `notbooks/text-generation` and launch the `jupyter` environment.``\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# change directory\n",
    "cd optimum-neuron/notebooks/text-generation\n",
    "# launch jupyter\n",
    "python -m notebook --allow-root --port=8080\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a familiar **`jupyter`** output with a URL to the notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can click on it, and a **`jupyter`** environment opens in our local browser. Open the notebook **`llama2-7b-fine-tuning.ipynb`** and lets get started.\n",

    "\n",
    "When it comes to distributed training on AWS Trainium there is a few things we need to take care of. Since Llama is a big model it might not fit on a single accelerator, thats why we added support for different distributed training strategies to the `NeuronTrainer` including: \n",
    "* [ZeRO-1](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/frameworks/torch/torch-neuronx/tutorials/training/zero1_gpt2.html): shards the optimizer state over multiple devices.\n",
    "* [Tensor Parallelism](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/libraries/neuronx-distributed/tensor_parallelism_overview.html): shards the model parameters along a given dimension on multiple devices, defined with `tensor_parallel_size`\n",
    "* [Sequence parallelism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05198.pdf) shards the activations on the sequence axis outside of the tensor parallel regions. It is useful because it saves memory by sharding the activations.\n",
    "* [Pipeline Parallelism](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/libraries/neuronx-distributed/pipeline_parallelism_overview.html): _coming soon_\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We prepared a [run_clm.py](./scripts/run_clm.py), which implements those distributed training strategies for you already. If you want to more about the details you can take a look at the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-neuron/guides/distributed_training). When training models on AWS Accelerators we first need to compile our model with our training arguments. \n",

But every change in the config, will lead to a new compilation, which could result in some cache misses. \n",

    "> AWS stands for Amazon Web Services. AWS is a suite of remote computing services offered by Amazon. The most widely used of these include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), which provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud; Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), which is an object storage service; and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), which is designed to provide high performance, durable block storage volumes for use with AWS instances. AWS also provides other services, such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), a service that enables organizations to control access to their AWS resources, and AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), which helps customers create and control the use of encryption keys.</s>"
